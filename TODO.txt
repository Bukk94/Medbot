### ISSUES ###
- Sometimes stream reader crashes on small buffer or some weird exception. It's not a problem (yet) and it's not causing any more issues but it's annoying. Attemp to fix this was made.

### IMPROVEMENTS ###
- Save user data as JSON instead of XML

- Remove static classes and create instance managers
- Remove BotClient from CommandsHandler

- Improve command handling, maybe create separate commands for each and use polymorphism to call out the function (instead of ugly swiches...)

### NEW STUFF ###
- Allow turn on/off bot's welcome/goodbye messages
- Make colors default value configurable

- Improve readme file with some docs how to setup the bot
- Activate Exp & Point timer only if broadcaster is live
- Command like !FollowerInfo to get follower info
- Create separate project with own Twitch Helix API
- Upload data to cloud for shared experience


### VERIFY ###
- Sending whisper messages

### ISSUES ###
- Sometimes stream reader crashes on small buffer or some weird exception. It's not a problem (yet) and it's not causing any more issues but it's annoying. Attemp to fix this was made.

### IMPROVEMENTS ###
- Save user data as JSON instead of XML
- Maybe convert other settings file to JSON too? For now it's OK-ish

- Remove static classes and create instance managers
- Remove BotClient from CommandsHandler

- Improve command handling, maybe create separate commands for each and use polymorphism to call out the function (instead of ugly swiches...)
- Denied permissions should write at least some logs to the console

- Bot loaded intervals are dictionary with string key. This should be enum to better access the value

- Implement better logging, like NLog

### NEW STUFF ###
- Allow turn on/off bot's welcome/goodbye messages
- Improve readme file with some docs how to setup the bot
- Activate Exp & Point timer only if broadcaster is live
- Command like !FollowerInfo to get follower info

### VERIFY ###
- Sending whisper messages
